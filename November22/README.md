After reading this week's reading, there are two videos immediately came into my mind.

One is 《茉莉花》Mo Li Hua by 洛天依(Vocaloid, by Vocaloid China Project)&方锦龙(Fang Jinlong, The representative of Chinese modern five-stringed pipa)

The other one is 《#夜航星》Ye Hang Xing by 洛天依(Vocaloid, by Vocaloid China Project)
[![Internet Medical Examination](http://i0.hdslb.com/bfs/archive/ad5719ad52e4150345b267105e28a21f2be0c77d.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBRc7bwoXLQ "Internet Medical Examination")
洛天依 is a virtual idol. A virtual idol is a virtual image that does not exist in real form. With the help of character modeling, real-time rendering, motion capture, face recognition and other technologies, it presents people's imaginary image with some of the group's favorite qualities, so that it appears on the screen like a real person to interact with fans.
In this performance, although you can feel that Fang Jinlong and Luo Tianyi are not the same kind of performers, but their performance is very harmonious. Although Luo Tian Yi's anthropomorphism is very high, but this does not make us feel creepy. is it that if the robot can achieve this level of anthropomorphism, it will not make people feel creepy?
I still wonder if it's the virtual nature of the virtual idol that keeps people from feeling scary, or if it's this image of him that keeps people from feeling scary.
