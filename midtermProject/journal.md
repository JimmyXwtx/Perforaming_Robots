For this robots, I am going to make a robot guards. Basically, there will be two eyes above its body to monitoring the nearby environment. If there is nothing dangerous happens, it will remains looking around and stay with a blue light. If there is some dangerous situation happens. It will run towards to the place it realized it is dangerous and turns the light to red to show it is dangerous.
Process:
