## September20 Robots Assignment

#### Definition of Robots

  Robot, is a human-like built tool, which usally used to play as a â€œhuman." In that case, robots' behaviour and logics of processing things will be human-iike.
  
#### Process documentation
  First, considered what I am going to make. Since I realized that the robots in my mind is like the robots WALL-E. So, based on this concept in mind, I started my installment. I cut the breadborad as the platform to place the arduino and the H-bridge. After a carefull physical computing, I put the battery, Arduino and the H-bridge on the top and two motor at the two side of the back bottom. It is quite easy to install the two back wheels. However, while I was about to install the two front wheels, I was trapped by the limitation of a stick to connect the two front wheels and make them rolling. Luckily, I found the wooden sticker I used for the coffee, I cutted them into the proper shape and success connected four wheels to this  system. It looks like

But it is quite obvious that this does not look like a robot, so, adding some decorarion to it.

#### Story of the movement
  As, I am trying to make a robots like the Wall-E, So, it has a "mind." He knows he could wonder wihtout hitting humans. So, I tried the diffrent speed of two motors to make it turn right and let it go back while he is going to hit the person.

 #### Difficulty
  one is the front wheel problem
  The other one is the robot does not move as what I expected, So, what I did was trying different voltage and realized that the difference between two motors should be like > 100 could make the robot turns rounds successfully.
  
 #### Interesting things
  
  Architecture is quite important for this course. Whlie I was building this robots, I once met the situation that the arduino could not be powered by the cables(cuz the space limitaion) based on my first design. This experience told me that I should plan everything ahead but changed what have done.
 
 #### Anytihng I want to add
 
  lol, plz I want a power jark to power the robots wirelessly
