### Internet Medical Examination-Situation Commedy
Brief: The work uses Internet medical examination as a metaphor to condense the current Chinese Internet users' life encountering such ills as paid overdrive, forced pop-up ads, personal information leakage, and restricted download speed, which has triggered hot debate among netizens.

#### How would you build the actor?

I am going to try to use the robot to replace the doctot actor in this sitcom. In case, this topic is aimed to satire the chaos of current Internet. If there is a robot doctor with Machine-generated Voice(Fake vocal) to treat the guy acted by real person.

#### How will you construct the actor to create the role?

My robot will act like what the female doctor did in this sitcom. However, I will tried to add the QR-Code, the ads in the sitcoms directly shows in the screen to express how rediculous this chaos of the current Internet is.

#### How will you decorate or dress the actor for best effect?

I will make the actor looks like this

There is a screen. So, the robots could ask the patient to watch ads or scan the QR-Code easily. That's what current Internet User is experiencing. Also, there is a blood sampling part. The doctor asked the patient to topup or it will be super slow to take the blood. If the doctor is acted by the robots. At this scene, it could stop and all body turns to red and jumped out a QR-Code, "Payment or wait." This would be super drama.

#### What sequence of moves or other actions will you give your actor so that they can best play the part?

I will simply add some move up and move back actions to behavior like a doctor. After that, I will put the digital vocal and the screen and the body light together. Once the robot is interacting with the patient. Its screen and light will changed based on the conversation going on.
