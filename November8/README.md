#### Propose an idea for a robot play or a scene from a play

I want to build two robots, as shown in the picture, two robots look the same. Then keep circling and keep chasing each other. Then while chasing, the robots will keep shaking their arms and never stop.
This scenario can actually be used to discuss the relationship between a human and a robot. Robots are always constantly executing commands from humans. When they receive a command to turn in a circle, they keep turning in a circle. For themselves, they only know that they are spinning. But for humans, we feel that they are chasing each other. But then they can't reach each other. People's code puts robots in a bind. But the robots never felt it, the people felt it.

##### Thoughts

Every time I read an article on a similar topic, I wonder what exactly is the stage. What do we want the objects on the stage to play out? What do we want the stage to bring out? Is a human actor on stage logically and essentially performing the actions of a robot? Although it is said that humans have their own brains and their own inner thoughts. However, what an actor should do in a good production is to interpret the author's ideas. In this regard, I think robots can do better than humans. But then, the stage is not like mathematical calculations, and sometimes mistakes on stage are part of the charm of the stage itself. It's really interesting to explore humans and robots on stage. Look between them, the interaction generated by the fascinating mistakes.

##### Question
This article made me think of an interesting question. The author mentions that people have a strong sense of time, so I wondered, how does a robot's sense of time look like? Or in what kind of a time dimension do robots interact?
